# Health XML Splitter

Health XML Splitter split large health exports generated by Health.app into smaller, individual chunks.

This app was built specifically for use with [Health Data Importer](https://lionheartsw.com/software/health-importer), the iOS app that you can use to import your Health data when migrating to a new device.

## Compatibility

This app runs on macOS 10.13 and above.

## Installation

You can download Health XML Splitter directly from the [macOS App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/health-xml-splitter/id1437100857?ls=1&mt=12) or through [direct download](https://github.com/lionheart/Health-XML-Splitter/releases/download/v1.0.1/Health.XML.Splitter.1.0.1.app.zip).


## Usage

* Drag and drop your `export.xml` or `export.zip` file right into the main window.
* Create a directory to save the generated chunks into.
* Let the app run until it's done processing the export. This may take a few minutes.
* Open the generated chunks using Health Data Importer on your iPhone.
